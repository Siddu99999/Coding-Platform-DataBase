# Coding-Platform-DataBase
This database gives a broad overview on how a Coding Platform works . We have analysed how the data is managed in general over many online coding websites and constructed an efficient DataBase .
This database consists of only essential components (entities) that covers almost all features of an efficient coding site, giving an edge to - <br/>● Participation in Weekly contests
<br/>
● Announcement of the results
<br/>
● Problems to practice , and
<br/>
● Store that helps users to buy the necessary goodies 
<br/><br/>
It mainly focuses on the entities and the relationships between them with all the key constraints.
<br/><br/>
